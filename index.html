                <h3>Computer Engineer</h3>
                <p><strong>I am Bishal Ghataney, a Computer Engineering senior at 
                    Iowa State University, set to graduate in May 2024. My 
                    experience spans various roles in technology and leadership. 
                    As a Technical Project Manager at Raytheon Technologies, I 
                    developed a tool that extracts technical information from 
                    engineering drawings, supporting a $100 million cost avoidance 
                    project. I also eliminated over 10800 minutes of manual processes 
                    per year through the development of a digital automation tool. 
                </strong></p>
                <p><strong>In my role as a Compliance/Software Developer at Collins Aerospace, 
                    I enhanced customer experience by applying the ETL process to Market 
                    Feedback data and optimized frontend pages across the supplier portal 
                    by writing advanced SQL stored procedures. As a Teaching Assistant for 
                    Linux Operating Systems, I facilitated instruction and enhanced course 
                    performance by guiding students on various technical aspects. As the founder 
                    of Dream Haven, I identified and validated a high-demand product in the US 
                    market, maximizing profit margins and customer base. Lastly, as a Machine 
                    Learning Research Intern at ISU, I investigated state-of-art ML models such 
                    as MobileNetV2 and CIFAR-100.

                <p>I am currently serving as a senior engineer on a project 
                    that aims to leverage artificial intelligence (AI) to 
                    improve the prediction of cancer occurrence and recurrence. 
                    Despite advancements in medicine, cancer remains a significant 
                    challenge due to the limited ability to predict its occurrence 
                    and recurrence. The project involves building and training a 
                    simple AI model for cancer prediction, with the goal of 
                    improving cancer treatment. The ultimate goal is to create an 
                    AI model capable of recognizing and predicting the risk of 
                    cancer occurrence and recurrence, which will be continually 
                    improved through training on multiple sets of data provided by 
                    leading research institutes and hospitals.
                </p>
                <p>As the main contributor and senior engineer on this project, 
                    I am utilizing my experience in AI and machine learning to 
                    lead the development and training of an AI model for cancer 
                    prediction. A significant part of my role involves focusing 
                    on training the model, with a particular emphasis on learning 
                    more about transfer learning. Transfer learning is a machine 
                    learning method where a pre-trained model is used as the 
                    starting point for a model on a second task. It’s a popular 
                    method in deep learning because it can train deep neural 
                    networks with comparatively little data. This is a big 
                    advantage in this project, as medical datasets are often small. 
                    I will be utilizing my knowledge of transfer learning to improve 
                    the accuracy of our model. Furthermore, I will also be responsible 
                    for validating the accuracy of the model, ensuring it’s reliable 
                    and robust before deployment.
                </p>
                <p>This role is allowing me to further develop my technical skills 
                    in Python, TensorFlow, and Keras. I am gaining practical experience 
                    in AI and machine learning, specifically in building and training 
                    AI models for medical diagnosis.
                </p>
                <p>My contribution to this project is significant. By leading the 
                    development of an AI model capable of recognizing and 
                    predicting the risk of cancer occurrence and recurrence, I am 
                    contributing to advancements in cancer treatment. This could 
                    potentially lead to improved patient outcomes and a better 
                    understanding of cancer.

                <p>During my COM S 309 course, I was part of a team that developed 
                    an ISU marketing app. This app was designed to facilitate the 
                    online sale of students’ belongings, thereby helping them 
                    generate profits. My specific role in this project involved 
                    coding functionalities for the creation and management of 
                    users in the database, as well as for admins and the 
                    validation of customer activities. This experience not only 
                    honed my technical skills but also provided valuable insights 
                    into the practical aspects of software development.
